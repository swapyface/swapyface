🔭 I am currently working as a Senior Data Scientist, leading AI/ML initiatives in the financial domain. I focus on building end-to-end machine learning pipelines, scalable LLM-powered systems, and production-grade AI solutions on cloud platforms like AWS and GCP.

🌱 I have 12+ years of experience in software development, with 7+ years specializing in data science and ML. My background spans finance, banking, and edtech, where I have built predictive models, NLP solutions, and experimentation platforms that drive business decisions.

👯 I am passionate about quant research and exploring opportunities in AI agents, generative AI, and fintech innovation. I also mentor aspiring data scientists and collaborate on open-source ML projects.

📝 I occasionally share insights on ML, AI agents, and productionizing models on my blog and LinkedIn.
